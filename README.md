This E-commerce Product Page is a web application designed to display information about different products. The page includes sections for three distinct products: Laptop, Headphones, and Smartwatch. Each product section provides a brief description, price, and an image to give users a clear visual representation. Users can also add products to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.

Additionally, the webpage features a "Terms and Conditions" section, where users can access information about the exchange and return policy. To enhance user experience, the terms content is initially hidden and can be revealed by clicking the "Show Terms and Conditions" button.

The webpage is built using HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. The responsive design ensures that the page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project serves as a starting point for an e-commerce platform, and further development could include backend functionalities, user authentication, and an actual shopping cart system for a complete online shopping experience.
